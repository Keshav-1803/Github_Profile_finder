## API Usage

The application uses the GitHub API to search for user accounts based on the provided query. The API endpoint used is:

```
https://api.github.com/search/users?q=${query}
```


## Project Structure

### `App.js`

The main component of the application responsible for handling user input, making API requests to GitHub, and rendering the search results. It utilizes state variables to manage user input and API response data. The `onSearchSubmit` function asynchronously fetches data from the GitHub API using the `findGithubAccounts` function, and the results are displayed using the `UserCard` component.

### `components/user-card/user-card.js`

A reusable component (`UserCard`) designed to display individual GitHub user cards. It takes in props such as `profileLink`, `accountLink`, and `username` to showcase the user's profile picture, GitHub account link, and username. The component is styled using CSS, and the styling details can be found in the accompanying `user-card.css` file.

### `components/user-card/user-card.css`

A stylesheet defining the visual aspects of the `UserCard` component. It sets the height, margin, padding, border, and flexbox properties for a clean and visually appealing display of user cards.

### `App.css`

The global stylesheet for the main application, providing styling for various elements. It includes styles for the overall app container (`app`), the main content area (`main`), and the search form (`search-form`). Specific styles for the input field and search button are also defined.
